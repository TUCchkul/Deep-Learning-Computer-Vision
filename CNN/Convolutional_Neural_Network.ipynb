    "# What are Convolutional Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of Neural Networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is comprised of one or more convolutional layers (often with a subsampling step) and then followed by one or more fully connected layers as in a standard multilayer neural network. The architecture of a CNN is designed to take advantage of the 2D structure of an input image (or other 2D input such as a speech signal). This is achieved with local connections and tied weights followed by some form of pooling which results in translation invariant features. Another benefit of CNNs is that they are easier to train and have many fewer parameters than fully connected networks with the same number of hidden units. In this article we will discuss the architecture of a CNN and the back propagation algorithm to compute the gradient with respect to the parameters of the model in order to use gradient based optimization.

The first layer is the lowest level in the hierarchy, where the CNN generally classifies small parts of the image into simple shapes like horizontal and vertical lines and simple blobs of colors. The subsequent layers tend to be higher levels in the hierarchy and generally classify more complex ideas like shapes (combinations of lines), and eventually full objects like dogs.\n",
